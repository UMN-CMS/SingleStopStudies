  abstract = {This article summarises three searches for diboson resonances in the all-hadronic final state using data collected at a center-of-mass energy of \$\textbackslash sqrt\{\textbackslash rm\{s\}\}=13\$ TeV with the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The boson decay products are contained in one large-radius jet, resulting in dijet final states which are resolved using jet substructure techniques. The analyses presented use 2.3, 35.9 and 77.3 inverse femtobarns of data collected between 2015 and 2017. These include the first search for diboson resonances using data collected at a 13 TeV collision energy, the introduction of a new algorithm to tag vector bosons in the context of analyzing the data collected in 2016, and the development of a novel multidimensional fit improving on the sensitivity of the previous search method with up to \$30\textbackslash\%\$. The results presented here are the most sensitive to date of diboson resonance searches in the dijet final state. An emphasis on improvements in technique for vector boson tagging is made.},

  abstract = {A search in an all-jet final state for new massive resonances decaying to WW, WZ, or ZZ boson pairs using a novel analysis method is presented. The analysis is performed on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 77.3 fb-1 recorded with the CMS experiment at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The search is focussed on potential narrow-width resonances with masses above 1.2 TeV, where the decay products of each W or Z boson are expected to be collimated into a single, large-radius jet. The signal is extracted using a three-dimensional maximum likelihood fit of the two jet masses and the dijet invariant mass, yielding an improvement in sensitivity of up to 30\% relative to previous search methods. No excess is observed above the estimated standard model background. In a heavy vector triplet model, spin-1 Z and W resonances with masses below 3.5 and 3.8 TeV, respectively, are excluded at 95\% confidence level. In a bulk graviton model, upper limits on cross sections are set between 27 and 0.2 fb for resonance masses between 1.2 and 5.2 TeV, respectively. The limits presented in this paper are the best to date in the dijet final state.},

A separate search is conducted for narrow resonances that decay to final states including b quarks. The first exclusion limit is set for excited b quarks, with a lower mass limit between 1.2 and 1.6 TeV depending on their decay properties. Searches are also carried out for wide resonances, assuming for the first time width-to-mass ratios up to 30\%, and for quantum black holes with a range of model parameters. The wide resonance search excludes axigluons and colorons with mass below 3.6 TeV, and color-octet scalars with mass below 2.5 TeV. Lower bounds between 5.0 and 6.3 TeV are set on the masses of quantum black holes.},

  abstract = {A search for narrow resonances decaying into dijet final states is performed on data from proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.8 fb-1. The data were collected with the CMS detector using a novel technique called data scouting, in which the information associated with these selected events is much reduced, permitting collection of larger data samples. This technique enables CMS to record events containing jets at a rate of 1 kHz, by collecting the data from the high-level-trigger system. In this way, the sensitivity to low-mass resonances is increased significantly, allowing previously inaccessible couplings of new resonances to quarks and gluons to be probed. The resulting dijet mass distribution yields no evidence of narrow resonances. Upper limits are presented on the resonance cross sections as a function of mass, and compared with a variety of models predicting narrow resonances. The limits are translated into upper limits on the coupling of a leptophobic resonance ZB to quarks, improving on the results obtained by previous experiments for the mass range from 500 to 800 GeV.},

The search considers hadronic decays of the vector boson, and Higgs boson decays to b quarks. The decay products are highly boosted, and each collimated pair of quarks is reconstructed as a single, massive jet. The analysis is performed using a data sample collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb-1. The data are consistent with the background expectation and are used to place limits on the parameters of a theoretical model with a heavy vector triplet. In the benchmark scenario with massdegenerate W and Z bosons decaying predominantly to pairs of standard model bosons, for the first time heavy resonances for masses as high as 3.3 TeV are excluded at 95\% confidence level, setting the most stringent constraints to date on such states decaying into a vector boson and a Higgs boson.},

The limits on both vector and axial-vector mediators, in a simplified model of interactions between quarks and dark matter particles, are presented as functions of dark matter particle mass and coupling to quarks. Searches are also presented for broad resonances, including for the first time spin-1 resonances with intrinsic widths as large as 30\% of the resonance mass. The broad resonance search improves and extends the exclusions of a dark matter mediator to larger values of its mass and coupling to quarks.},

  abstract = {The oldest and most robust technique to search for new particles is to look for `bumps' in invariant mass spectra over smoothly falling backgrounds. We present a new extension of the bump hunt that naturally benefits from modern machine learning algorithms while remaining model-agnostic. This approach is based on the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) method where the invariant mass is used to create two potentially mixed samples, one with little or no signal and one with a potential resonance. Additional features that are uncorrelated with the invariant mass can be used for training the classifier. Given the lack of new physics signals at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such model-agnostic approaches are critical for ensuring full coverage to fully exploit the rich datasets from the LHC experiments. In addition to illustrating how the new method works in simple test cases, we demonstrate the power of the extended bump hunt on a realistic all-hadronic resonance search in a channel that would not be covered with existing techniques.},

  abstract = {We study the theory and some experimental hints of ultraheavy resonances at the LHC. The production of an ultraheavy narrow particle may have a larger rate than the QCD background even when the final state includes only hadronic jets. We consider two classes of models that lead to 4-jet signals. In the first class a diquark scalar decays into two vectorlike quarks. In the second one a coloron decays into two color-octet scalars or into a pair of vectorlike quarks. We show that a diquark as heavy as 11.5 TeV, or a coloron as heavy as 8.5 TeV may be discovered at the LHC. We point out that a CMS 4-jet event may be due to an 8 TeV resonance decaying into two secondary particles, each with a mass of 1.8 TeV. We find that the QCD background with a 4-jet mass and dijet masses that equal or exceed those of the CMS event is approximately \$5\textbackslash times 10\^\{-5\}\$ events in 78 fb\$\^\{-1\}\$ of data, while the diquark signal could have easily produced that event. The diquark also decays directly into two jets, which may be the origin of some of the three other events of mass near 8 TeV observed by ATLAS and CMS.},

Motivated by naturalness of the Higgs potential, which would favor light third-generation squarks, and the stringent LHC bounds on spectra in which the gluino or first and second generation squarks are light, we focus on scenarios dominated by the pair production of light stops. We consider the various possible direct and cascade decays of the stop that involve the trilinear RPV operators. We find that in many cases, the existing searches exclude stops in the natural mass range and beyond. However, typically there is little or no sensitivity to cases dominated by UDD operators or LQD operators involving taus. We propose several ideas for searches which could address the existing gaps in experimental coverage of these signals.},

Our approach is based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression \textemdash{} a powerful and flexible machine learning technique which has allowed us to model the background without specifying its functional form explicitly and separately measure the background and signal contributions in a robust and reproducible manner. Unlike functional fits, our GPregression-based approach does not need to be constantly updated as more data becomes available. We discuss how to select the GP kernel type, considering trade-offs between kernel complexity and its ability to capture the features of the background distribution. We show that our GP framework can be used to detect the Higgs boson resonance in the data with more statistical significance than a polynomial fit specifically tailored to the dataset. Finally, we use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to confirm the statistical significance of the extracted Higgs signature.},

The study is based on a 138 fb-1 sample of proton-proton collisions collected at 13 TeV with the CMS detector. Many models of new physics predict the production of events with jets and electroweak gauge bosons, with little or no missing transverse momentum. Examples include stealth models of SUSY, which predict a hidden sector at the electroweak energy scale for which SUSY is an approximately unbroken symmetry. The results are interpreted in the context of simplified stealth models with gluino and squark pair production. The observed data are consistent with the Standard Model prediction, and gluino (squark) masses of up to 2.1 (1.85) TeV are excluded.},

Next, the GPR was described concisely together with an implementation of a standard GPR algorithm. Beyond the standard GPR, packages to implement state-of-the-art Gaussian processes algorithms were reviewed.

The analysis is based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS detector in 2016\textendash 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV at the CERN LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb-1. The search is sensitive to resonances with masses between 1.3 and 6 TeV, decaying to bosons that are highly Lorentz-boosted such that each of the bosons forms a single large-radius jet. Machine learning techniques are employed to identify such jets. No significant excess over the estimated standard model background is observed. A maximum local significance of 3.6 standard deviations, corresponding to a global significance of 2.3 standard deviations, is observed at masses of 2.1 and 2.9 TeV. In a heavy vector triplet model, spin-1 Z and W resonances with masses below 4.8 TeV are excluded at the 95\% confidence level (CL). These limits are the most stringent to date. In a bulk graviton model, spin-2 gravitons and spin-0 radions with masses below 1.4 and 2.7 TeV, respectively, are excluded at 95\% CL.
